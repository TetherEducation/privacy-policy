        <h1>Backoffice Assistant – Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 11 Nov 2025</p>
        <p>
            Backoffice Assistant is an internal Chrome extension built by Tether
            Education to help the CRM team manage integrations with educational
            services. The extension is designed for authenticated institutional
            users only. This document explains what data we access, how we use
            it, and the safeguards in place.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Data We Process</h2>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Category</th>
                    <th>Examples</th>
                    <th>Purpose</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Authentication tokens</td>
                    <td>
                        OAuth access tokens, refresh tokens issued by Keycloak
                    </td>

                        Maintain an authenticated session with Tether services

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Educational service credentials</td>
                    <td>
                        JWT tokens, session cookies, institution identifiers
                        (RBD codes)
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        Automate integrations and provision tokens to the

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Basic user profile</td>
                    <td>Name, corporate email, campus assignments</td>
                    <td>Display account status inside the extension UI</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Technical metadata</td>
                    <td>
                        Browser version, extension version, timestamps,
                        success/error logs
                    </td>
                    <td>Troubleshooting, rate limiting, and audit logs</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
            The extension <strong>does not</strong> collect browsing history,
            unrelated form inputs, financial information, or student personal
            data.
        </p>

        <h2>2. How We Use The Data</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Automated integrations</strong> – captured tokens are
                sent to the Credential Manager and Integration Core
                microservices hosted by Tether Education.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Credential management</strong> – tokens are encrypted
                locally (AES-256-GCM) and persisted only for the minimum time
                required to deliver them to the CRM.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Operational analytics</strong> – aggregate events
                (success, failure, timestamps) are logged to monitor service
                reliability. No advertising or profiling is performed.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>3. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Tokens and credentials are kept in encrypted extension storage
                (<code>chrome.storage.local</code>) and cleared immediately
                after they are acknowledged by the backend.
            </li>
            <li>
                Server-side services retain encrypted copies following Tether’s
                retention policy (maximum 90 days) for auditability.
            </li>
            <li>No data leaves Tether-controlled infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Sharing With Third Parties</h2>
        <p>
            We do not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties. Data is
            transmitted exclusively to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>https://api.v2.tether.education/*</code> (Credential
                Manager & Integration Core)
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>https://auth.tether.education/*</code> and
                <code>https://auth.dev.tether.education/*</code> (Keycloak
                Identity)
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>https://app.tether.education/*</code> (Backoffice web
                application)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>All traffic is transmitted over HTTPS with TLS 1.2+.</p>

        <h2>5. User Controls</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Users must authenticate with their corporate Google Workspace
                account through Keycloak.
            </li>
            <li>
                Tokens can be revoked at any time inside the Backoffice
                Assistant popup (Logout button).
            </li>
            <li>
                Removing the extension from Chrome deletes all locally stored
                data.
            </li>
        </ul>
